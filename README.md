# ffplay-wrapper
For those of you who want to use ffplay but are too lazy to type out the command every time for some reason

A little backstory: my parents have made installed time limits and downtime into my computer, so that means the Music app is basically off limits, which is kind of sad. So I resorted to using `ffplay`, which I had conveniently installed when I got `ffmpeg` in my cover project, but it was kind of annoying having to constantly type out the command when I restarted terminal. 
So I made this thing, which under normal circumstances is completely useless. Enjoy!
